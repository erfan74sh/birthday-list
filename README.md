# birthday list with React JS

this is a simple birthday list (or you can say birthday reminder) made with react js. and also a little use of jquery . 
you can add persons by name, birthday date and also upload a photo for each. the app categorize the birthday list in three categories as birthdays in 30 days, 90 days and more than that. I use Neumorphism for the simple and minimal style.

thanks for your feedbacks
